Discover the tools software developers use to build scalable **AI-powered** algorithms in **TensorFlow**, a popular open-source machine learning framework.

### This is a **four-course Specialization**. 
* Begin by building and training neural networks. 
* Improve a network’s performance using convolutions. 
* Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. 
* Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. 
* You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!

### The Four Courses Contain:
1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
  * [Codes](https://github.com/XXDIL/TensorFlow-Specialization/tree/master/Intro%20to%20TensorFlow%20(AI%2C%20ML%20and%20DL))
